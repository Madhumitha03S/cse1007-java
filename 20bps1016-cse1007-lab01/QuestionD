 * In every layer there are red and orange petals. 
 * It has 2 red and 3 orange petals always in the inner layer. 
 * In ith layer the number of red petals will be equal to the number of orange petals in i-1th layer 
 * and number of orange petals will be equal to total of red and orange petals of the i-1th layer. 
 * For a given layer, find the number of petals. */
